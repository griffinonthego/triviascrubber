Next:
- Save JSONs (to bypass google search API)

Todo:
- Improve local OCR reliability, as it is faster than online API 
- Gather more screenshots (batch cropped) for additional testing
- Add functionality to accommodate multi-word searches
- Word swapping?
- Move window setup to separate class so that updating them in one location updates for both the checker and the main functions
    - Maybe just change vars location so check_setup can share
- Add GUI with “Go” button and live results counter
